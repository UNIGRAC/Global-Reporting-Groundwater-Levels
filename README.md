# Global Reporting on Groundwater Levels
Since 2023, IGRAC assists the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) with the preparation of the section on Groundwater Levels in the [State of Global Water Resources report](https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-global-water-resources). This repository contains the programs (and associated reports) that have been developed to report on Groundwater Levels:
1) Global Reporting on Groundwater Levels, 2022 (2023)
- Jupyter notebook: [Global Reporting on Groundwater Levels 2022 - Algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/e75117cd11ec13a6b8fb32e8610fd35af9e341bc/Global%20Reporting%20on%20Groundwater%20Levels%202022%20-%20Algorithm.ipynb)
- Methodology report: [Global Reporting on Groundwater Levels 2022 - Report.docx](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/ac831a6615600f63633a0477c6e059d9958a1d79/Global%20Reporting%20on%20Groundwater%20Levels%202022%20-%20Report.docx)

2) Updated Methodology for Data Selection and Groundwater Level Trend Analysis (2023)

- Jupyter notebook: [Groundwater level trend analysis - Updated methodology for selecting the data.ipynb](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/b3e4c6bccfe4d3b903159db3dad25c6f26054f7e/Groundwater%20level%20trend%20analysis%20-%20Updated%20methodology%20for%20selecting%20the%20data.ipynb)
- Demo dataset: [Ogallala_2001_2020.csv](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/e7505cbc2b06735f20f15a3ba332f29aba60c570/Ogallala_2001_2020.csv) 
- Methodology report: [Updated methodology for Data Selection and Groundwater Level Trend Analysis.docx](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/da67e04f85a09d1af1abbacad4e79a4a3218ae1c/Updated%20methodology%20for%20Data%20Selection%20and%20Groundwater%20Level%20Trend%20Analysis.docx)
