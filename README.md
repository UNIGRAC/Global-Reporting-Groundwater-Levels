# Global Reporting on Groundwater Levels
Here a word of explanation about our work with WMO


This repository contains the following programs (and associated reports):
1) Global Reporting on Groundwater Levels 2022
- 
2) Updated methodology for Data Selection and Groundwater Level Trend Analysis
By clicking on [Groundwater level trend analysis - Updated methodology for selecting the data.ipynb](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/b3e4c6bccfe4d3b903159db3dad25c6f26054f7e/Groundwater%20level%20trend%20analysis%20-%20Updated%20methodology%20for%20selecting%20the%20data.ipynb) a Jupiter notebook file has been used where it focuses on:

A new data filtering method that utilizes a threshold percentage between specified start and end dates, conducting monthly analysis on well time series data and categorizing it into accepted data and rejected data based on the threshold. Additionally, the repository includes functions for autocorrelation analysis, utilizing Statsmodels to generate autocorrelation plots with lags displayed. The MK_tests function conducts Mann-Kendall tests on time series data, offering flexibility with different test options, and the MK_plot function visualizes the results through informative plots for each well. The final section of the code conducts exploratory data analysis using the [Ogallala_2001_2020.csv](https://github.com/UNIGRAC/Global-Reporting-Groundwater-Levels/blob/e7505cbc2b06735f20f15a3ba332f29aba60c570/Ogallala_2001_2020.csv) file, providing users with a comprehensive visual representation of the results for insightful data exploration.
